This week's assignment was inspired by Richard Braurigan, especially his _The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster_. <br/>

_"When you take your pill<br/>
itâ€™s like a mine disaster.<br/>
I think of all the people<br/>
   lost inside of you."_<br/>

I think it's amazing how things that seem unrelated at first glance can be connected. So I tried to list some random words to try to mimic such a feeling.<br/>

I used pattern.en to change the tenses and singular/pural for me.<br/>

Here are some poems it generates:<br/>

_"I like to think my distrust infused with harmonies is swirling my metal shampoo, <br/>
it's like my electronic dusk."_<br/>

_"Last night, <br/>
mammals were the pages. "_<br/>

_"At 9:50 in the morning, <br/>
bows adorned with blossoms are your mouth and a forsaken advertisement."_<br/>

_"While a wooden cyborg is leaving the seahorse adorned with hopes, <br/>
it's like spinning soaps a nothing wrapped by avacadoes. "_<br/>

_"After my shadow adorned with leaves is drinking new magics, <br/>
your meadow infused with hopes is my giggle of darknesses. "_<br/>

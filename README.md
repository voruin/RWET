# RWET

I used two text materials: one is *Ode on Dictionaries* (by Barbara Hamby), and a ramdom generated texts of talking on TV (including weather forecasts, news, variety shows, etc.)

I tried to show the scene and feeling of myself watching TV in the morning, constantly switching channels with boring programs, lost in thought and playing a game of sentence solitaire in my head (Use the last word of the previous sentence as the beginning to make a word and use the word to make a sentence).

### Outcomes example:

>
> "Tomorrow's forecast calls for mostly sunny skies with a..."
> A-BOMB is how it begins with a big bang on page one.
> 
> (changing channel)
> 
> "...council meeting is scheduled for next..."
> THE house stinks, and but those damned mice have SKEDADDLED.
> 
>  (changing channel)
> 
> "...a high of 60 degrees..."
> like a STRAY Cheeto found in your pocket the day after you finish the bag.
>  
>  (changing channel)
>  
> "Stay tuned to find..."
> but those DAMNED mice have skedaddled, or DON'T as the case may be.
>  
>  (changing channel)
>  
> "...bring him out, let's take a look..."
> slipping words in my pockets like a non-smudge lipstick that smears with the first KISS, and my SAMUEL Johnson in a frock coat.

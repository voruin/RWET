I kind of like what I did last assignment, so I continued to work on it this assignment. 

Last assignment, I got feedback from classmates that it would be more fun to change different style on the generated "bug". I was thinking about change different text source to make that until I learned a new way from [this reference](https://github.com/aparrish/rwet/blob/master/understanding-word-vectors.ipynb): using spacy to make that. I tried add a fine tune prompt and factor ahead of the file. And contents will tinting it's meaning to the prompt. 

In my test, I used word "universe" and "neuron". It worked out better than I thought!

**- "universe"**
